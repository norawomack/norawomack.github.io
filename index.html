<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>
👋🏼 I'm Nora, that's me. This is my first website. <br>
👩🏻‍💻 I'm new to coding, but learning fast. I'm working with html, css, webpages, Python, and some AI. In my past coding class (taught by my mom!), I learned about encrpytion and cyphers, too.

I'm building a video game company with several game ideas cooking. 
This is my Video Game website:
